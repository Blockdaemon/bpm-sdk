    # Getting Started

    ## What is a BPM package?

    A BPM package is, in it's simplest form, just a binary that accepts certain commands and returns specific values. While it is possible to write a package in any programming language as long as it fulfills the [Package Contract](#section/Package-Contract), it is recommended and significantly easier to use the provided [Go SDK](#section/Go-SDK).

    ## How to implement a new package?

    The different ways to develop a package are:

    - [Implementing a package for docker deploy](#section/Go-SDK/Implementing-a-package-for-docker-deploy) using the [Go SDK](#section/Go-SDK)
    - [Implementing a package for arbitrary deploy targets](#section/Go-SDK/Implementing-a-package-for-arbitrary-deploy-targets) using the [Go SDK](#section/Go-SDK)
    - Implementing a binary that fulfillls the [Package Contract](#section/Package-Contract) to create a BPM package in any programming language

    Before implementing a new package we recommend to review the example workflow below to get a feel for how a package interacts with the `bpm` cli. After that we recommend to jump right into [Implementing a package for docker deploy](#section/Go-SDK/Implementing-a-package-for-docker-deploy).

    In addition the [Development Tips](#section/Development-Tips) can be quite useful.

    ## Submitting a package

    To submit a new package for inclusion in the Blockchain Package Registry, please contact the [Blockdaemon support](mailto:support@blockdaemon.com).

    # BPM workflow

    The communication between `bpm` and a package is based on the following ideas:

    * A bpm package is a binary that supports commands defined in this document
    * `bpm` calls the package's `meta` command to get information about the package
    * `bpm` calls other package commands to manage a node
    * `bpm` passes node information to the package via `node.json` file

    ## Installing a package

    ![Install Diagram](https://dev-bpm-sdk-docs.storage.googleapis.com/docs/install.png)

    When a user runs `bpm install <package>`:

    1. `bpm` downloads the package binary from the Blockchain Package Registry into `~/.bpm/plugins/<package>`
    2. `bpm` calls `~/.bpm/plugins/<package> meta`. This returns the meta information (e.g. version, allowed parameters, etc.) about the package.
    3. `bpm` saves the package information in `~/.bpm/manifest.json`

    ## Configuring a node

    ![Configure Diagram](https://dev-bpm-sdk-docs.storage.googleapis.com/docs/configure.png)

    When a user runs `bpm configure <package> --parameter1 --parameter2 foo`:

    1. `bpm` creates the file `~/.bpm/nodes/<node-id>/node.json` which contains the parameters specified in the `bpm configure` command
    2. `bpm` calls `~/.bpm/plugins/<package> validate-parameters ~/.bpm/nodes/<node-id>/node.json`. This validates the parameters that are stored in `node.json`
    3. If supported (based on the meta information), `bpm` calls `~/.bpm/plugins/<package> create-identity ~/.bpm/nodes/<node-id>/node.json`. This creates the identity (e.g. private keys) of the node
    4. `bpm` calls `~/.bpm/plugins/<package> create-configurations ~/.bpm/nodes/<node-id>/node.json`. This creates the configuration for the blockchain runtime

    ## Starting a node

    ![Start Diagram](https://dev-bpm-sdk-docs.storage.googleapis.com/docs/start.png)

    When a user runs `bpm start <node-id>`:

    1. `bpm` calls `~/.bpm/plugins/<package> start ~/.bpm/nodes/<node-id>/node.json`. Most packages currently deploy to Docker using these steps:
      - Create a docker network (if it doesn't exist yet)
      - Create all the blockchain client docker container(s) and containers with the monitoring agents (if they don't exist yet)
      - Start the docker containers (if they aren't started yet)

    # Development Tips

    ## Installing a package from a binary

    Usually packages are installed by downloading a file from the package registry. During development it is often useful to install directly from a local file.

    This can be done with the following command:

    ```
    bpm packages install <package name> --from-file <package file>
    ```

    ## Debug mode and troubleshooting

    `bpm` has a debug mode to print more information about it's internal doings. Just add `--debug` to any command. Example:

    ```
    bpm packages install <package name> --debug --from-file <package file>
    ```

    ## Running a package directly without bpm

    Sometimes it can be useful to run individual package commands directly, without invoking the `bpm`. This allows to test those commands individually. Please note that this is not how an end user would run a package.

    To run a package directly we first have to create a node configuration file (`node.json` - although for this purpose it can be an arbitrary filename). Please refer to [node.json](#section/Package-Contract/node.json) for details about the file format. A useful starting point is to copy an existing `node.json` from `~/.bpm/nodes/<node-id>/node.json`.

    With the node configuration file it is possible to run a package command like this:

    ```
    ./binaries/skeleton-master-darwin-amd64 create-secrets node.json
    ```

    ## Automatically setting the version

    Go has the capability to overwrite variables at compile time like this:

    ```bash
    go build -ldflags "-X main.version=$VERSION" -o plugin-name cmd/main.go
    ```

    This can be used in a continuous integration pipeline to automatically version the binaries with e.g. the current git tag.

    See https://gitlab.com/Blockdaemon/bpm-polkadot/-/blob/master/Makefile#L6 for an example.

    # Go SDK

    The BPM SDK makes it easy to implement new packages using the Go programming language. Find the sourcecode at [Github](https://go.blockdaemon.com/bpm/sdk).

    ## SDK Components

    ### docker

    Package docker provides a simple docker abstraction layer that makes it very easy to start and remove docker containers, networks and volumes.

    For more information please refer to the [API documentation](https://godoc.org/go.blockdaemon.com/bpm/sdk/pkg/docker).

    ### node

    Package node provides an easy way to access node related information.

    For more information please refer to the [API documentation](https://godoc.org/go.blockdaemon.com/bpm/sdk/pkg/node).

    ### template

    Package template implements functions to render Go templates to files using the node.Node struct as an imnput for the templates.

    For more information please refer to the [API documentation](https://godoc.org/go.blockdaemon.com/bpm/sdk/pkg/template).

    ### plugin

    Package plugin provides an easy way to create the required CLI for a plugin. It abstracts away all the command line and file parsing so users just need to implement the actual logic.

    For more information please refer to the [API documentation](https://godoc.org/go.blockdaemon.com/bpm/sdk/pkg/plugin).

    ## Implementing a package for docker deploy

    Most current packages deploy simple docker containers. The Go SDK provides the base functionality for this.

    What follows is a step by step introduction for writing a package.

    A complete but simple example is available on github for [Polkadot](https://gitlab.com/Blockdaemon/bpm-polkadot/).
    A more advanced example with multiple containers and configuration parameters is available on github for [Stellar](https://gitlab.com/Blockdaemon/bpm-stellar).

    ### Create an empty package

    In a new and empty directory, create a file `main.go` with the following content:

    ```
    package main

    import (
      "go.blockdaemon.com/bpm/sdk/pkg/docker"
      "go.blockdaemon.com/bpm/sdk/pkg/plugin"
    )

    func main() {
      parameters := []plugin.Parameter{}

      templates := map[string]string{}

      containers := []docker.Container{}

      name := "test"
      version := "1.0.0"
      description := "A test package"

      testPlugin := plugin.NewDockerPlugin(name, version, description, parameters, templates, containers)
      plugin.Initialize(testPlugin)
    }
    ```

    `plugin.NewDockerPlugin` does most of the heavy lifting here. It instantiates an implementation of `Plugin` with useful defaults for docker deployments.

    This is already a fully functional BPM package. We haven't implemented any `templates`, `parameters` or `containers` yet so the package won't do much.

    Build the package binary:

    ```
    go build -o test main.go
    ```

    Usually a user would install a package from the BPM Registry. To shorten the development cycle we will instead install the package directly from the local file:

    ```
    bpm packages install test --from-file ./test
    ```

    Finally, we can test our package:

    ```
    bpm nodes configure test --name a-test-node
    bpm nodes start a-test-node
    bpm nodes remove --all a-test-node
    ```

    It can sometimes be useful during development to use the package directly without going through the `bpm`. Remember, a package is itself just a binary so it can be executed directly:

    ```
    ./test --help
    ```

    should print the following help:

    ```
    A test package

    Usage:
      test [command]

    Available Commands:
      create-configurations Creates the configurations for a blockchain node and stores them on disk
      help                  Help about any command
      meta                  Shows meta information such as allowed parameters for this plugin
      remove-config         Remove the node configuration files
      remove-data           Remove the node data
      remove-runtime        Remove everything related to the node itself but no data, identity or configs
      start                 Starts the docker containers
      status                Gives information about the current status
      stop                  Stops the docker containers
      upgrade               Removes the docker containers
      validate-parameters   Validates the parameters in the node file

    Flags:
      -h, --help   help for test

    Use "test [command] --help" for more information about a command.
    ```

    ### Define the parameters

    We want to be able to parameterize the package. A common example is to to provide different "node configuration types". Let's add a parameter to switch between `watcher` and `validator` nodes.

    ```
    parameters := []plugin.Parameter{
      {
        Name:        "subtype",
        Type:        plugin.ParameterTypeString,
        Description: "The type of node. Must be either `watcher` or `validator`",
        Mandatory:   false,
        Default:     "watcher",
      },
    }
    ```

    After building and reinstalling the package we can now set the subtype using the `bpm`:

    ```
    go build -o test main.go
    bpm packages install test --from-file ./test
    bpm nodes configure test --name a-test-node --subtype watcher
    ```

    The resulting node configuration file in  `~/.bpm/nodes/a-test-node/node.json` should now contain the value specified using `--subtype`:

    ```
    {
      "id": "a-test-node",
      "plugin": "test",
      "str_parameters": {
        "docker-network": "bpm",
        "subtype": "watcher"
      },
      "bool_parameters": {},
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
    ```

    Remove the node before continuing with the next step:

    ```
    bpm nodes remove --all a-test-node
    ```

    ### Configuration templates

    Before launching containers we need to create a configuration file for the blockchain software. By default, the `plugin.NewDockerPlugin` creates a package
    that uses `plugin.FileConfigurator` to generate configuration files from templates. All we need to do is provide a template and a destination filename for the new
    configuration file.

    ```
    polkadotTemplate := `polkadot
    --base-path
    /data
    --rpc-external
    --name
    {{ .Node.ID }}
    --chain
    alexander
    {{ if eq .Node.StrParameters.subtype "validator" }}
    --validator
    {{- end }}
    `

    templates := map[string]string{
      "configs/polkadot.cmd": polkadotTemplate,
    }
    ```

    Again, let's build and run the package to see the outcome:

    ```
    go build -o test main.go
    bpm packages install test --from-file ./test
    bpm nodes configure test --name a-test-node --subtype watcher
    ```

    It should create a file in `~/.bpm/nodes/a-test-node/configs/polkadot.cmd` with the following content:

    ```
    polkadot
    --base-path
    /data
    --rpc-external
    --name
    a-test-node
    --chain
    alexander
    ```

    ### Containers

    Finally, for the package to actually do something we need to define a container that launches the blockchain software.

    ```
    containers := []docker.Container{
      {
        Name:    "polkadot",
        Image:   "docker.io/chevdor/polkadot:0.4.4",
        CmdFile: "configs/polkadot.cmd",
        Mounts: []docker.Mount{
          {
            Type: "volume",
            From: "polkadot-data",
            To:   "/data",
          },
        },
        Ports: []docker.Port{
          {
            HostIP:        "0.0.0.0",
            HostPort:      "30333",
            ContainerPort: "30333",
            Protocol:      "tcp",
          },
          {
            HostIP:        "127.0.0.1",
            HostPort:      "9933",
            ContainerPort: "9933",
            Protocol:      "tcp",
          },
        },
        CollectLogs: true,
      },
    }
    ```

    Let's try it:

    ```
    go build -o test main.go
    bpm packages install test --from-file ./test
    bpm nodes configure test --name a-test-node --subtype watcher
    bpm nodes start a-test-node
    ```

    This should start a container called `bpm-a-test-node-polkadot`. We can check the status using `bpm`:

    ```
    bpm nodes status
    ```

    This concludes this tutorial. You now have a very simple but functional BPM package for running Polkadot.

    ## Implementing a package for arbitrary deploy targets

    BPM does not enforce deployment targets. While the bulk of packages deploy simple docker containers, it is entirely possible to deploy to other platforms. Examples could be Kubernetes, Systemd, etc.

    The [BPM SDK](https://go.blockdaemon.com/bpm/sdk) provides helper functions to create such a package using the Go programming language. The steps are:

    1. Implement the [pugin interface](https://godoc.org/go.blockdaemon.com/bpm/sdk/pkg/plugin#Plugin)
    2. Call [initialize](https://godoc.org/go.blockdaemon.com/bpm/sdk/pkg/plugin#Initialize) with an instance of the struct implementing said interface

    # Package Contract

    ## Overview

    The following sections describe how the `bpm-cli` communicates with a bpm package. The [Go SDK](#section/Go-SDK) makes it easy to implement a package correctly so that it follows the contract described here.

    Each package is a binary file that:

    * Reads information from a configuration file (`node.json`)
    * Provides a defined list of commands with specific behaviour

    ## node.json

    When a new node is launched, the `bpm-cli` creates a configuration file with parameters for this particular node.

    ### nodes.json example

    ```
    {
      "id": "broken-hill-8831",
      "plugin": "parity",
      "str_parameters": {
        "bootnodes": "enode://8b1dfdfb02ebf4[...]5290624f86c11c5a3adf4991c8ded7@104.199.180.203:30303",
        "chain-spec": "~/Downloads/chain.json"
      },
      "bool_parameters": {
        "validator": true
      },
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
    ```

    ### node.json structure

    | Field           | Description                                                                                         |
    | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | id              | The node name                                                                                       |
    | version         | The version of the package with which this node was created. This is important for upgrade purposes |
    | str_parameters  | A dictionary containing parameter names and their values (strings)                                  |
    | bool_parameters | A dictionary containing parameter names and their values (booleans)                                 |

    ## Commands

    Each package must implement the following commands:

    | Command               | Description |
    | --------------------- | ----------- |
    | create-configurations | Creates the configurations for a blockchain node |
    | meta                  | Shows meta information such as allowed parameters for this plugin |
    | remove-config         | Removes the node configuration |
    | remove-data           | Removes the node data |
    | remove-runtime        | Removes everything related to the node itself but no data, identity or configs |:was
    | start                 | Starts the node |
    | status                | Gives information about the current node status |
    | stop                  | Stops the node |
    | validate-parameters   | Validates the parameters in the node file |

    Each package may implement some of the following commands:

    | Command               | Description |
    | --------------------- | ----------- |
    | create-identity       | Creates the nodes identity (e.g. private keys, certificates, etc.) |
    | remove-identity       | Removes the node identity |
    | upgrade               | Upgrades the node to a newer version of a package |
    | test                  | Runs a test suite against the running node |

    Non-mandatory commands may or may not be implemented in a bpm package. The `meta` command returns information about
    the package, incl. information about which optional commands are available.

    Except for the `meta` command (which is described in detail below), each of the commands above takes exactly one parameter which points to the node's `node.json`. Example:

    ```
    <package binary> create-configurations <node.json>
    ```

    The package commands must follow these rules:

    * If something fails, the command must return an error code that is not 0
    * Error messages must go to stderr
    * Commands must be idempotent

    > An operation is idempotent if the result of performing it once is exactly the same as the result of performing it repeatedly without any intervening actions. [[1]](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html)

    This is typically implemented by first checking if an action has already been applied and only taking action if it hasn't. This has a few benefits:

    - It allows manual intervention. Example: A user can supply their own node secret. If the file already exists, bpm will not re-create it
    - Commands can be run multiple times without causing weird side effects
    - Automation is easier because we don't need to save state (i.e. which commands where already executed)
    - Implementing new plugins is simpler because one can just re-run the command while implementing it

    ## meta

    Every package needs to implement a `meta` command. This command returns information about the package in yaml format. This information is being used by the `bpm`.

    ### meta example

    ```
    name: polkadot
    version: 1.0.0
    description: A polkadot package
    protocol_version: 1.1.0
    parameters:
    - type: string
      name: docker-network
      description: If set, the node will be spun up in this docker network. The network
        will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
      mandatory: false
      default: bpm
    - type: string
      name: subtype
      description: The type of node. Must be either `watcher` or `validator`
      mandatory: false
      default: watcher
    - type: string
      name: validator-key
      description: The key used for a validator (required if subtype = validator)
      mandatory: false
      default: ""
    supported:
    - test
    - upgrade
    ```

    ### meta structure

    | Field                  | Description |
    | ---------------------- | ----------- |
    | version                | The version of the package used to configure this node. This is useful to know when upgrading the node |
    | description            | A human-readable description of the package |
    | protocol_version       | A version denoting the protocol between `bpm` and the package (i.e. what is described in this document). Current version is `1.1.0`. |
    | parameters             | A list of parameters that can be used during the `nodes configure <package>` command |
    | parameters.type        | `string` or `bool` |
    | parameters.name        | The name of the parameter, should use `-` to separate words |
    | parameters.description | A human-readable description of the parameter |
    | parameters.mandatory   | Whether the parameter is mandatory. If a parameter is mandatory, `bpm` will enforce that parameter. If not it will use the default value. |
    | parameters.default     | The default value if no parameter is specified by the user |
    | supported              | A list of supported methods |

    `supported` describes which optional commands are implemented in the package according to the following table.

    | String   | Commands                         |
    | -------- | -------------------------------- |
    | upgrade  | upgrade                          |
    | test     | test                             |
    | identity | create-identity, remove-identity |
